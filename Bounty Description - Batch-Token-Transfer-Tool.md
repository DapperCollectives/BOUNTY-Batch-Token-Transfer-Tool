# Overview
The Batch Token Transfer Tool allows for a user to easily set up and automate transfers to multiple Flow wallet addresses from a single Flow wallet address. Useful to anyone who manages a community or works with multiple collaborators, this tool saves users the time required to initiate transfers individually to large groups of people.

Using the Batch Token Transfer Tool, a user should be able to accomplish the following:

- Connect their Flow wallet
- See their token balance displayed clearly
- Select a token in their wallet to start a batch transfer with
- Paste in or upload a list of Flow addresses and payment amounts
- Review the details of the batch transfer: what their starting balance of the selected token is, how many recipients will receive tokens, the full list of recipients and payment amounts, and what their token balance will be once the transactions are completed


# Key Features for Initial Release
- Ability to connect a Flow wallet and see its token balances
- Ability to select what type of token to use for the batch transfer
- Ability to paste in or upload a list of recipient Flow addresses and corresponding token amount to be paid
- Ability to review full details of batch transfer before initiating the transaction

# Project Bounty
- $20,000 USD - to be paid out in equivalent value of $FLOW tokens in 25% installments across each milestone

# Bounty Overview

Weâ€™re looking for small teams of experienced engineers and product designers who are excited to build out tools for the Flow ecosystem. Our bounty program favors builders that are interested in working collaboratively with Dapper Collectives to make Web3 more open and accessible to all. Every bounty is broken up into several milestones that allow teams to collect feedback, show progress, and collect milestone payments.

For the Batch Token Transfer Tool project, the milestones are:


1. Product Requirements Documentation and Tech Spec Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a thorough PRD for how the Batch Token Transfer Tool will work and associated technical documentation for how the product will be built. This should include a maintenance plan for the code once deployed.
   - Review the documentation with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure the viability of the implementation
   - Due within 10-14 days from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

2. Front-End Prototype Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a clickable prototype of the Batch Token Transfer Tool front-end that clearly illustrates the anticipated user flows for a production build
   - Review the front-end prototype with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect UI/UX feedback
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

3. Back-End and Smart Contract Review + Acceptance
   - Walk through the technical implementation of the back-end of the Batch Token Transfer Tool
   - Review with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure viability of the implementation
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

4. Production-Grade Build Complete
   - Provide full codebase for the Batch Token Transfer Tool for review by the Dapper Collectives team
   - Due within 4 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
   - Upon reaching Milestone 4, the codebase for the Scaffold-Flow must be turned over to Dapper Collectives for final deployment
